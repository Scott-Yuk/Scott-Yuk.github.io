Prior to taking ICS 111 I had taking a year of AP Computer Science in highschool and learn about the basics. I was expecting the professor at the time to just go over things I already learned in the previous year, but this professor wanted to change thigns up. He had a passion for coding visually and so he incorporated something called EZ.java into the lessons. With the EZ.java library we're able to create images on the screen using java. Now having the EZ.java library the classes was givin a project to create something with it. 

The first idea in mind was try to create a game, and so I brainstormed a simple idea and brought it to life. The player is a dog named yip and lost his toys, the objective of the game is to collect the 5 items spread across the screen while avoiding the items dogs tend to not like. As this was the first ever game I tried to create I had a lot of ideas with no clue on how to code it, but taking things one step at a time I was able to make my vision come true. Starting with the basics like creating an image on the screen, then setting the boarders, and importing the images, I had full control of what I wanted to make and in the end I got the A.
