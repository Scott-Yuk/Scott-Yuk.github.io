As junior year is starting to come to a close I was left with the question, what do I want to study after high school? At this point of my life I didn't have anything that
I wanted to pursue or study, but I just knew I had to go to college. Looking that the choices I had, I wanted to try something new. Looking at all the AP classes offered AP Computer Science interested me the most, and so that begins my adventure on the path to computer science.

## In the context of engineering



## In the context of relationships



## Okay!
