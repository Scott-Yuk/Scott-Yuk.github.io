## Learning Design Patterns

Hearing about design patterns for the first time I thought it would be a reoccurring theme within code, like a motif. To some degree I was right because a design pattern refers to a common issues that have general solutions in software engineering. Almost like a one size fits all approach, although no one size truly fits all it's close enough.

## Following the Recipe

Now learning what a design pattern is, it reminds me of following a recipe. In this case the food being the program we want to create, and the recipe guiding us to the end product. For example if you were to make bread for the first time from scratch without following a recipe it would be probably be terrible. Somethings just wouldn't work out like maybe the dough would be sticking everywhere, then come to find out you could use flour or oil to help the dough not stick. A coding example could be using a factory to return an object. Functions and tips already exist for these common issues that we all face, so finding a recipe to what we want can be crucial to getting to the end goal.

## My Experience of Following the Recipe

Prior to learning about design patterns, I never knew I was already using them. In many of my computer science courses, they would cover general concepts and apply them to code without really telling why it works the way it does. An example of this is using the idea of classes in C and javascript, were we can use classes to pass information around. These everyday design patterns that I never realized where design patterns, help create amazing code just by following following the recipe.
