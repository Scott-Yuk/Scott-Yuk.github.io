## Starting with Standards
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/MLA.png">

In coding, something that I believe should be at least mentioned to everyone is camelCase. A naming convention that was made to form multiple words as one word by capitalizing the first letter of the word(s) after the first word. Although camelCase seems like a trival part of creating a functional program, it improves legibility a lot and in a way is a part of the coding standard. Like many things in life, there is uniformity to make it easier to communicate and understand each others ideas. An example I'll use will be the picture of the MLA format for writing essays. Essays come in many different styles and formats, but MLA is the format used the most. Comparing the coding standard to the MLA format, we follow this style to make it easy to read our ideas in a structured way. Although we are free to talk about or code what we want, when it comes time to collaborate or release our work into the world, having it structured just makes it easy for everyone.

My expirence with having a coding standard starting when I took my first class in computer science. Although it wasn't really the priority, he did encorage nice clean looking code. Probably because he's the one that have to grade our code. From then on my college professors started to implement more coding standards and now in ICS 314 it is taking it to another level. Although I'm aware of most of the coding standards there are a few errors within eslint that I never thought of being an error, and so I know I have much more to learn.
