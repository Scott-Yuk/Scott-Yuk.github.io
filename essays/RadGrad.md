## A struggling start

My first experience with RadGrad was in my ICS 211 class. My professor introduced RadGrad to the entire class, going through the reason behind it and showing us the how to explore the website and find things we may be interested in. At the time I was interested and explored the website and even planned a semester in advance along with finding an upcoming internship I found while looking through the different opportunies that where available at the time. This would've been a great first into college and I say would've because I didn't really follow up with what I planned. At the time I was so focued on taking one semester at a time and didn't give much thought into the future, so I forgot about RadGrad and just tried to keep going forward without a plan.

## A tool not utilized

About two years has passed since I was introduced to RadGrad and now that I've revisited the website thanks to my ICS 314 professor I realized that I could've done so much more if only I used everything I was given. RadGrad is ment for ungraduates to start thinking about college as a whole and plan how they want to go about college and even find opportunities in any interest they may have. Being able to build a profile with add certain field of interest like gaming, computer learning, database, etc... to that profile and find others that share those interest is amazing. Ontop of that, being able to find real world opportunities on the same website is astounding. So much functionality in this site, it could've made planning for classes much easier.

Now that I'm nearing the end of my third year in college I've been looking for different opportunities to help me get some experience in the world and I haven't used everything to my advantage. Although I advisors and google to help me search for experience I could've just used a website designed to help student like me find internships and different opportunities. 

## For the future

From my introduction to RadGrad to now revisiting it and using it again I realized that now I have another source to help myself plan for the future. It may be a little late, I still have some time before graduation to use RadGrad and get learn about the different opportunities available to me.
