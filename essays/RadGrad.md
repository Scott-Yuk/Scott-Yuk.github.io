## Making the Map

If I can sum up my freshman year of college into three words it would be "What's going on". I was a clueless freshman and I think some of my peers were as well, kinda going through the motions and taking classes we where told to by our advisors, might've just been me... Now that I'm in my third year college I've started to do some reflecting on my college experience and what I can share is that I had a lot of fun quarantining at home. Really though seeing that I'm in my third year of computer science I feel very underwhelmed and I refuse to blame covid-19 because I lacked the plan. From freshman year to my third year of college I lacked a plan, never really aiming for anything other than to pass my classes and I think that's my downfall.
