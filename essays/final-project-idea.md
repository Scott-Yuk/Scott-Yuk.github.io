## Overview

Problem: Wanting to play a group sport, working with someone but have no one to ask or not enought people? 

Solution: Our idea called "Workout Warriors" connects the UH community together and offers opportunities to meet new people and join group activities 
with other stsudents.

## Approach

Project: Sports Squad
Overview
The problem: UH students can often ignore exercise, due to a busy schedule. Although a lot of people like to work out alone, many prefer a partner/group to workout with for a variety of reasons.

The solution: Study Buddy is an application for UHM ICS students to self-organize face-to-face study groups around a course and/or specific homework or project topic.
Approach
To use Workout Warrior, a student must login and set up their profile. The profile enables each student to list workouts they seek (running, sport, swimming, weightlifting, etc.), along with their intensity and skill level. Thus, all students are on the same page and know what to expect once they arrive at the gym. Each student must also provide a headshot so that they can be visually identified.

Another section of the site lists all of the Workout options. Within each type of workout, it is possible to see the variety of students and their levels. Each student can set a time to work out and the type of workout they will be participating in (for example, “Weightlifting”, and a time to meet within UH Student Gym (i.e. 8:30 pm - 9:30 pm tonight)). Doing so generates a notification to all students, who can join the workout group.
There is an online calendar that shows all of the workout sessions and who is attending.

There are two styles of use for Workout Warrior:
You want to plan a group workout session for later in the day or some subsequent day. In that case, you schedule for some time in the future.
You are at the gym right now. In that case, you can go into Workout Warrior and schedule the session for “Right Now!”. Letting students know you are at the gym and ready to work out, hopefully generating a reaction and allowing others free to join you!
