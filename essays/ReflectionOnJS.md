## A starting point

<img class="ui tiny left circular floated image" src="../images/software-code.jpg">

So far I've only learned java, C and bit of C++ and so I went into the freeCodeCamp relying on my previous knowledge of the languages I already know.
Overall the basics of javascript and ES6 was fairly easy to me and was familiar due to my knowledge of java.
Though I didn't struggle with the syntax of javascript at times and learned a lot of interesting things specific to javascript that I wish was in Java.
Like variables not needing to be assigned a type like in java, and functions being more straight forward compared to java.

## Starting again

My experience using javascript was refreshing and exciting. For the majority of my computer science journey I've only really used java as my coding language.
Doing the CodeCamp felt like relearning java in the sense that I am learning a new language and trying to figure out all the little intricacies within the language.
And going deeper into javascript with ES6 opened more possabilities with javascript and what the language can really do.
Even now completing the basics of javascript and the ES6 modules I still don't really know the possiblities of javascript. 
So I hope to learn as much as I can and expand my knowledge of javascript as I continue my journey of coding.

## Training the brain

Now that I'm furthuring my knowledge of coding I feel like certain bits of information is forgotten, and this may just be true for me but I do often forget things.
Especially when learn more advanced concepts, it's hard to maintain and test what I learned. Having WODS (Workout Of the Day) feel very good.
These short exercises that help test my knowledge of what I just learned helps me maintain the information but also shows me what I need to work at more.
For example the two WODs I've tried showed me that I can learn the syntax and ideas of a new language, but timing myself and being more efficient needs work.
Overtime with more experience and pratice, my skills in coding will improve and help me find what I want to pursue in computer science.
